**SDynPy** is a package for performing structural dynamic analyses using Python.
It contains several objects that represent various structural dynamics data
types (shapes, data, geometry, etc.) as well as various functions and methods
to make working with these objects easy!

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information on how to use the package,
including how to :ref:`install <installation>` the package.

To quickly get running with SDynPy, check out the  out the :doc:`examples` for
an overview of recommended workflows and a summary of current functionality.
