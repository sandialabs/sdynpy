Core Functionality
==================

This section of the SDynPy documentation describes the core functionality of the
package.

At its core, SDynPy contains objects that represent typical objects that are
commonly used in structural dynamics.  These objects are designed to make it
easier to perform common tasks in structural dynamics, including signal
processing, visualization, and bookkeeping.
