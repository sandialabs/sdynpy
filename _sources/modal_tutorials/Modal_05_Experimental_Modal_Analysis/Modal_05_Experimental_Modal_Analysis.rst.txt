Modal Tutorial 05: Experimental Modal Analysis
==============================================

In the previous tutorial we saw how we could compute
modal properties of a system from its mass, stiffness,
and damping matrices.  Unfortunately, real dynamic
systems do not have mass, stiffness, and damping
matrices readily available.  Therefore, modes of the
system must be derived experimentally, generally from
the time histories of the excitation force applied to the
system and the responses to that excitation measured
from the system.

The sub-tutorials in this section will walk through
various parts of this process to demonstrate how
experimental modal analysis is performed.
